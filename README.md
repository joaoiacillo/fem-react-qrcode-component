## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) - Module Blunder


### What I learned

This is my first project developed with ReactJS. It is simple, but it contains all the knowledge I have so far about the library.

### Continued development

- Component abstraction
- Breaking components into smaller components

### Useful resources

- [freeCodeCamp ReactJS Course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/#react) - This is where I'm learning ReactJS at the moment.
- [02 - Why React & Secret Sauces - React Fundamentals - Why React is a Declarative - Mastering Reactjs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_Lfqk6oQ7o) - This is an amazing video made by 
Tapas Adhikary that freeCodeCamp recommended me about the fundamentals of React. It covers the concepts of declarative, imperative and component-based.
